## 🚀 Key Projects

### ⚡ **[Turbo-TOSEC](https://github.com/DeponesLabs/turbo-tosec)**
> *High-performance data ingestion & audit engine for big datasets.*

A cutting-edge demonstration of modern **Data Engineering** on local machines. Turbo-TOSEC solves the bottleneck of processing massive DAT files by utilizing a **Map-Reduce** architecture with **DuckDB** and **Parquet**.

* ✅ **Architecture:** Multi-process (Map) -> Parquet Storage -> Bulk Load (Reduce).
* ✅ **Performance:** Processes gigabytes of XML data in seconds, not hours.
* ✅ **Tech:** Python, DuckDB, Pandas, XML Stream Parsing.

### 🕹️ **[Skryer](https://github.com/DeponesLabs/skryer)**

> *Specialized Retro-Gaming Archive Manager & High-Performance Launcher.*

Originally conceived as a high-speed visualization engine for **Turbo-TOSEC** data, Skryer has evolved into a specialized management suite for large-scale retro-gaming collections. The architecture utilizes advanced indexing and local-first data processing to provide a seamless environment for managing and launching massive software archives.

* ⚠️ **Status:** **Active Development (Initial R&D Phase).** The current implementation focuses on core architectural integrity and high-speed data fetching frameworks. Functional expansion is ongoing.
* ✅ **High-Speed Indexing:** Capable of handling million-record collections with zero-lag navigation using embedded OLAP technologies.
* ✅ **Native Performance:** Engineered with Python and PySide6 to ensure a responsive desktop experience for massive local datasets.
