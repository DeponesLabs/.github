## 🛠️ Our Mission

We bridge the gap between complex data processing and user-friendly desktop experiences. Whether it's analyzing millions of records locally or crafting distraction-free editors, our philosophy is the same: **Respect the hardware, respect the user.**

We build tools that are offline-capable, privacy-focused, and engineered for maximum performance.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### ⚡ **[Turbo-TOSEC](https://github.com/DeponesStudio/turbo-tosec)**
> *High-performance data ingestion & audit engine for big datasets.*

A cutting-edge demonstration of modern **Data Engineering** on local machines. Turbo-TOSEC solves the bottleneck of processing massive DAT files by utilizing a **Map-Reduce** architecture with **DuckDB** and **Parquet**.

* ✅ **Architecture:** Multi-process (Map) -> Parquet Storage -> Bulk Load (Reduce).
* ✅ **Performance:** Processes gigabytes of XML data in seconds, not hours.
* ✅ **Tech:** Python, DuckDB, Pandas, XML Stream Parsing.

### 📝 **[Glyph](https://github.com/berkacunas/Glyph)**
> *A modern, multi-tab Markdown editor built with Python & PySide6.*

Glyph combines the flexibility of web technologies (Chromium) with the raw performance of native code (Qt). It stands as our proof of concept for robust desktop GUI engineering.

* ✅ **Live Preview:** Side-by-side rendering with instant feedback.
* ✅ **Professional:** PDF export, advanced syntax highlighting, distraction-free mode.
* ✅ **Open Source:** Licensed under GPLv3.
